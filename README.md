# Frontend for Project W
This is the frontent/client for Project-W written in Svelte + Typescript. It is designed such that it entirely runs in the users browser, no server side code required (no node.js in production)! To learn more about Project W (including its frontend) and how to install or compile it, [visit its documentation](https://project-w.readthedocs.io). Other components of Project W are [the backend](https://github.com/JulianFP/project-W) and [the runner](https://github.com/JulianFP/project-W-runner).

## Can I fork this or write my own?
Of course, feel free! While all three components (frontend, backend, runner) are required to run a functioning Project W setup, they have been designed in a modular way so that they can be replaced, especially the frontend/client. Visit the documentation to learn about the backends API if you want to write your own client.
