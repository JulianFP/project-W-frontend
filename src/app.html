      <h2>JavaScript seems to be disabled</h2>
      <p>The Project-W frontend is a SPA and as such requires JavaScript to function. Your browser doesn't seem to support JavaScript. Try enabling it in your browser settings or try again with a different browser.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you can also check out <a href="https://project-w.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the API docs</a> if you want to use Project-W without the official frontend (there are also nicer Swagger and ReDoc docs available but accessing them requires JavaScript too).</p>
